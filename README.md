# myhashalgorithm
 This repository showcases a custom hash function implementation that combines the power of PBKDF2 key derivation and ChaCha20 encryption. The custom hash algorithm provides a unique and secure way to hash input data, incorporating robust password-based key derivation and encryption techniques. By leveraging the strength of PBKDF2-HMAC for key generation and ChaCha20 for data encryption, this repository offers an educational exploration of creating a personalized hashing mechanism. Developers can gain insights into cryptographic principles and their application in building a reliable custom hash function for various data hashing needs.
